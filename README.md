# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to predict whether a female has diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements. Using machine learning, we analyze various health indicators to build a predictive model for diabetes detection.The model achieves an **accuracy of 86%**, making it a reliable tool for early diabetes prediction. 

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:  
[Diabetes Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)  

## Model Deployment  
The trained model is deployed on Hugging Face for easy access and inference:

## Technologies Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)  
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Random Over-Sampling (to handle class imbalance) 
- Streamlit (for deployment)  
- Hugging Face (for model hosting)
